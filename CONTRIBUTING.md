## Contributor Behavior

Be kind to one another. I'm striving to make RGO-lib-parser an inclusive environment that's great for first time open-source contributors.

tldr; i value constructive community interaction, over technical acumen.

## Pull Requests

RGO-lib-parser use the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) as main versioning workflow

1. Create a new branch for each feature, fix or improvement
2. Send a pull request from each feature branch to the **main** branch

It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate feature branches, and to send a
pull request for each branch.

This allow me to review and pull in new features or improvements more efficiently.
